## How to Add Images

### Step 1: Organize Your Images
Add your service images to the appropriate directories:
```
public/
  gallery/
    wall-painting/          -> Wall Painting images
    wall-collage/          -> Wall Collage images  
    vinyl-prints/          -> Vinyl Prints images
    totems/               -> Totems images
    3d-signage/           -> 3D Signage images
    roll-up-standees/     -> Roll-up Standees images
    photo-panels/         -> Photo Panels images
    ... (create more as needed)
```

### Step 2: Update Service Gallery Arrays
In `app/services/page.js`, find the service you want to update and modify its gallery array:

```javascript
{
  id: 3,
  title: "Wall Collage",
  // ... other properties
  gallery: [
    "/gallery/wall-collage/collage-1.jpg",
    "/gallery/wall-collage/collage-2.jpg", 
    "/gallery/wall-collage/collage-3.jpg",
    "/gallery/wall-collage/collage-4.jpg",
  ],
}
```

### Step 3: Remove Placeholder Images
Currently, some services have placeholder Unsplash images for demonstration. Replace these with your actual images:

```javascript
// REMOVE these placeholder URLs:
"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-...",

// REPLACE with your actual images:
"/gallery/your-service/image-1.jpg",
```

## Example: Adding Wall Collage Images

1. Add your images to: `public/gallery/wall-collage/`
   - `collage-1.jpg`
   - `collage-2.jpg`
   - `collage-3.jpg`
   - etc.

2. Update the service in `app/services/page.js`:
```javascript
gallery: [
  "/gallery/wall-collage/collage-1.jpg",
  "/gallery/wall-collage/collage-2.jpg",
  "/gallery/wall-collage/collage-3.jpg",
  "/gallery/wall-collage/collage-4.jpg",
],
```

## Image Recommendations

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: 800x800px minimum (square aspect ratio works best)
- **Quality**: High resolution for zoom functionality
- **File Size**: Optimize for web (under 500KB per image)
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names like `service-name-1.jpg`

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Implemented:**
- Service popup system (gallery-only modal)
- Image gallery grid display
